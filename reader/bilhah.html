      <p>I do not remember the face of my mother. Only the weight of her hands—warm, trembling—on my shoulders the day the raiders came. I remember her pushing me behind a reed basket, whispering, “Stay quiet, Bilhah.” But I was small, and fear was quick. I stepped out too soon. A man with a scar down his cheek saw me, grabbed my arm, and that was the last time I ever saw my mother's hut, my river, my childhood.</p>
      <p>I learned later that Zilpah had been taken the same day from a village not far from mine. We were both about ten years old, both terrified, both clinging to each other in a chain of children tied with rope and shame. No one told us where we were going or why. When you are a child in a slave caravan, you learn early that answers are for the powerful. We were sold several times before reaching Harran. By then, Zilpah and I had become sisters by necessity. We slept huddled together in cold markets, whispered stories to each other to push back nightmares, shared the hard crusts that passed as meals. But we never cried where others could see; tears were dangerous. They marked you as weak.</p>
      <p>Laban bought us from a trader who lied about our origins, claiming we were from noble families taken in war. Laban only laughed, squeezed our arms to judge our strength, and paid less than the trader asked. We were not noble. We were not even people, not in the way that counts. We were girls to be shaped into servants—silent, obedient, invisible.</p>
