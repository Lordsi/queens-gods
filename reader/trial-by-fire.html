      <p>The trial ground was a circle of black stone, scorched by countless flames. Elara stood in the center, her hands loose at her sides. Around her, the council watched in silence.</p>
      <p>"You have been chosen," the High Elder said. "But choice is only the beginning. The mark you carry must be tempered. Today, you prove that you can withstand the fire."</p>
      <p>Elara nodded. She had trained for this. She had read the accounts of those who had come before her. None of that could fully prepare her for the wall of flame that erupted from the ground.</p>
      <p>Heat washed over her. She did not flinch. The spark in her chest flared in response, and for a moment she felt not fear but recognition—as if the fire were an old friend, finally come home.</p>
      <p>When the flames died down, the council was standing. The High Elder's face was unreadable. "It is done," she said. "You have passed the first trial. There will be others."</p>
      <p>Elara bowed. Inside, the spark had grown again. She was ready for whatever came next.</p>
