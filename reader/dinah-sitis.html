      <h2 style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin: 0 0 1rem;">Chapter One — Whisper in the Ashes</h2>
      <p>I had lived long enough with Job to know the rhythm of his footsteps, the tone in his breath, even the weight of his silence. I knew the tilt of his head when he was thinking, the faint lift of his brow when he was amused, the softening of his voice when he prayed. His presence had always been the steadiness in our home, the warmth at our table, the anchor in storms both small and great. But nothing—nothing—prepared me for what those days became. Days when God Himself felt like a stranger wandering through the ruins of our life.</p>
      <p>“The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.” These words were not just for the children, all our wealth, given by God, was taken. We lost our home from debtors. We had nothing to trade. All animals, servants and property destroyed. Job and I ended up at the community dunghill. I had to go from house to house looking for work to buy us bread. Yet Job remained standing in his belief.</p>
      <p>I wanted to match his faith. Truly, I did. But faith has a weight, and mine slipped through my fingers like ash. I grieved alone at night, my cries muffled in my cloak. I felt abandoned—by God, by heaven, by sense.</p>
      <p>Then came the day his body broke. Sores—angry, festering, refusing to heal—crept across him until he was swallowed by pain. His skin cracked, bled, blistered. His breaths came in broken shudders. The man who once walked with kings now scratched himself with shards of pottery while sitting in ashes. And I? I stood beside him, not knowing whether to hold him… or run into the desert and scream until my voice died.</p>
