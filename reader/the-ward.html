      <p>The ward was the oldest part of the citadel—a ring of standing stones that predated the kingdom itself. Elara had been brought here at dusk, when the light was thin and the boundary between worlds was said to grow permeable.</p>
      <p>"You will spend the night inside," her guide had said. "If you emerge before dawn, you have failed."</p>
      <p>The stones hummed with power. Elara could feel it in her teeth. She walked to the center of the circle and sat down, cross-legged, and waited.</p>
      <p>At first there was only the wind and the stars. Then the whispers began. Not words—impressions. Fear. Longing. Triumph. The echoes of everyone who had ever sat where she was sitting.</p>
      <p>Elara did not fight them. She let the feelings pass through her like water through a sieve. When the first light touched the eastern stone, she stood. Her legs were stiff. Her mind was clear.</p>
      <p>She had passed. The ward had accepted her. And somewhere in the depths of the citadel, a door that had been closed for a hundred years began to open.</p>
